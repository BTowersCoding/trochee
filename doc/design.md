# Trochee design

The Trochee keyboard will be designed to optionally house a variety of single-board computers to provide a complete modular computing system, minus a monitor and pointing device. Built-in solutions for these may be explored in the future but are currently out of the scope of initial prototyping.

A few models will be made to house an [AtomicPi](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Pi-High-Speed-Peripheral/dp/B07N298F2B) single-board computer. It is sadly a bit underpowered and only has 2GB RAM, but at just $31 for an x86 processor capable of running Windows, they ought to not be passed up. For the first time, a consumer can be offered a complete modular system without asking them to learn a new operating system, or be limited to using sofware that runs on ARM.
